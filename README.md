# Algebraic Codes and Cryptography
In this repository I will upload from time to time, some of the algorithms related to the theory of codes and cryptography that interest me the most. It is an open project so collaboration is welcome. For several years I was a professor of this subject at the University of Salamanca in the degrees of mathematics and computer engineering. I thank my students for how much they taught me with their questions and comments :smiley:	

The motivation for using Mathematica software :computer:	is that it is used in most math schools, and sometimes its functionalities are not known outside of the academic community.
